Evaluating the risk of corrosion
The following formula can be used for evaluation:
Calculated conductivity = measured conductivity [μS/cm] – (measured total hardness [dH GH] x constant)
– Measured conductivity in μS/cm
– Measured total hardness in dH GH
– Constant = 30 [μS/cm]/[ dH GH]

– Measured total hardness 18 dH GH
– Calculated conductivity = 700 μS/cm – (18 x 30 μS/cm) = 160 μS/cm
The result of the calculation is 160 μS/cm and means that there is a low risk of corrosion.

Tips for good coffee beverages
NOTICE
Poor beverage quality
The oil from the coffee beans is deposited on the inside of the bean hopper as a thin film of oil. This de-
posited oil ages quickly and impairs the taste of the beverages produced.
a) Remove the oil film from the inside of the bean hopper on a daily basis.
b) To do this, use a dry cloth or a cloth moistened only with water.
c) Do not use any cleaners, as these alter the taste of the coffee.
